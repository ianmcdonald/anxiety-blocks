* Anxiety Blocks
A web page for a trilogy of recordings, collectively called /Anxiety Blocks/, dating from 2008 to 2009. 

The page allows a listener to play the pieces either in isolation, or any variety of simultaneous playback at any interval. It also provides a minimal visual accompaniment to the audio pieces. 

All sounds were generated with a Roland SH-101 monophonic synthesizer, recorded direct-in style to computer, multi-tracked and mixed.
